# WWDC18 Scholarship Submission
**Introduction**

Welcome to my submission for the WWDC18 Scholarships - Guess The üìß„ÄΩÔ∏èüí£üé∑üç¶ (Emoji)! This is my second attempt at running for the much-prized scholarship, last time being last year where I was rejected :( . 

**Status**

Rejected

**Description**

The objective is to Guess the Emoji behind the silhouette and select the answer out of the four choices in the given time-frame, which is not shown! When you request a hint in medium and hard levels, the emoji reveals itself, the words unjumble, and the first letter of the answer is spoken. Try to get the correct answer and don‚Äôt take too long or else the emoji bomb will explode! You have 50 questions, that if you all get correct, you diffuse the emoji bomb and win the game!
